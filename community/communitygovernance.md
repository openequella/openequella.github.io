Announcement of new members is done on-list.

## PMC Member Emeritus
PMC members who fail to participate actively in the work of the PMC over a 12 month period or who are unable to participate in PMC work due to other responsibilities will be accorded "emeritus" (inactive) status and their binding vote will be suspended.

Changes in status from active to emeritus and from emeritus to active will be determined by a simple majority of active PMC members. Status changes can be initiated by request of the PMC member concerned at any time.

## Removal of PMC chair and vice-chair
A PMC member, whether active or emeritus, may resign at any time for any reason.

A PMC chair or vice-chair can be removed at any time, with or without cause, by a vote of no confidence comprising a simple majority of active PMC members.

## Voting
In general, voting is by lazy consensus:

**Vote: Meaning**

+1: Approve

 0: Abstain

-1: Disapprove

-1 - Votes must be accompanied by a detailed explanation. A single -1 vote based on a material objection will block action. However, -1 blocking votes can be overridden by a 2/3 majority roll call vote of active PMC members.

Voting will be open for a period of 3 working days (Saturdays and Sundays excluded).

Proposals should contain the following text:

*As a reminder, this is a public, on-list vote with a "+1" signifying approval. Per our governance documents, a -1 vote must be accompanied by a detailed explanation. A single -1 vote based on a material objection will block action. However, -1 blocking votes can be overridden by a 2/3 majority roll call vote of active PMC members.*

## Elections
Nominations for Chair and Vice-Chair should be made publicly and can include self-nominations.

If there is only one candidate, the nominee is usually just declared elected.

If a vote is required, it is usually secret with an unbiased PMC member (e.g. not a candidate, such as current PMC chair) gathering the votes and reporting the results.
