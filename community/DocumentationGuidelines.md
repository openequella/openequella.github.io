# Documentation Guidelines
There are several repositories that support the Equella project besides the core 'Equella' repository.  Documentation that is specific to that repository's build and setup process should be in the given repository's README.md (or linked from the README.md to a documentation file in the same repository).

Further documentation, how-to guides, FAQs, System Admin guides, etc should be in the equella.github.io repo and linked from the given repository's README.md
