# Overview
openEQUELLA is an advanced digital repository that can be integrated with the Brightspace learning management system. From within Brightspace, users can access the openEQUELLA repository to search, create and manage content such as images, audio, video, packaged content, web links, text, PDFs and Microsoft Office™ documents. Content can then be incorporated into Brightspace courses.
The purpose of this guide is to demonstrate to users how to integrate openEQUELLA resources using Brightspace. Users will learn how to search for, create and manage available resources, and how to add these materials to courses. 

For information on configuring openEQUELLA in Brightspace, refer to the openEQUELLA Brightspace Configuration Guide.

Please note that this guide has been developed using openEQUELLA version 6.4 (QA2) and Brightspace version 10.5.3 and as such may differ in appearance to your own installation. 


Additional details about using openEQUELLA with an LMS Integration can be found in the [Integrated LMS User Guide](IntegratedLMSUserGuide.md)
