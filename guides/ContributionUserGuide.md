## Item contribution overview

The openEQUELLA Digital Repository allows users to search, discover, create, store, manage, view and share resources. An openEQUELLA resource is a grouping of metadata (information) and digital content. Resources enter the openEQUELLA repository by contribution using a wizard based web form.

Resources are contributed to the repository using a customized contribution wizard. Each resource is stored in a Collection and each collection belongs to a Category

Contribution wizards are customized by adding different wizard controls that prompt users to input text, make selections, upload files, add links and various other actions. 

The purpose of this guide is to demonstrate to users how to contribute resources to openEQUELLA using a contribution wizard. Users will also gain a broad overview of the wizard control types that can be used when contributing items. 

Please note that this guide has been developed to best reflect the full capabilities of openEQUELLA, and as such may differ in appearance to your own installation based on the permissions and configurations set for your institution. 


## Digital Repository  

**To access openEQUELLA** 
1. Open a browser and enter your openEQUELLA URL (e.g. http://equella.myinstitution.edu).
2. Log in to openEQUELLA to display the openEQUELLA Dashboard page. 

## Contribute resources to collections

Every resource contributed to openEQUELLA is saved in a collection, and each collection belongs to a category. There may be multiple collections and categories, and privileges may be set so users will see only relevant categories and collections. 

To access the Contribute page, select Contribute from the navigation menu.

The Contribute page displays, with available collections listed under their categories. When selected, each contribution link opens the associated contribution wizard. 

### Contribution wizards
Contribution wizards prompt contributors for details relevant to the resources being contributed to openEQUELLA. The amount of information collected is set by the institution, but the more metadata (information) collected for a resource, the more ‘discoverable’ it becomes in the openEQUELLA repository.

The appearance and sequence of contribution wizard pages can be different for each collection, and can change according to:
* the type of user;
* moderation progress; and
* information previously entered in the contribution process.

In addition to collecting information, a contribution wizard may contain controls that allow users to:
* upload individual or multiple files, including zip files
* add YouTube™, iTunesU™, Flickr™, Kaltura and Google Book™ links
* organize uploaded items with a navigation tree
* import and export IMS, METS, QTI and SCORM packages
* add URL links
* create HTML pages
* select and add taxonomy terms.
### Contribution wizard pages
Contribution wizards can be a single page or multiple pages, depending on their configuration.
Contribution wizard pages are made up of the following elements:
* Contribution page name—this name also appears on the page links to the right-hand side.
* Wizard controls—various wizard controls may be displayed..
* Page control buttons— 
* Save —saves the resource to the selected collection.
* Save and continue – saves the resource as draft if it hasn’t been saved before, or updates the existing record for pre-existing resources.
* Cancel—displays a confirmation dialog box. Click OK to cancel the current contribution.
* Page label controls – lists the names of the wizard pages as links.
* Preview—displays the resource as it will look if saved at this point.
* Select thumbnail – opens the Select thumbnail page.

NOTE: The Save button and Save and continue, Cancel, page label, Preview and Select thumbnail links move if the page is scrolled so they will always appear in the top right-hand corner of the page.

Contribution wizard controls can be dynamic, only displaying once a particular option is selected. This helps to collect meaningful data during the contribution process, while only showing the user relevant fields.

An asterisk after a field label indicates a mandatory field.

### Page control buttons 

Links to the page names display on the right-hand side of the contribution wizard, and, depending on the wizard configuration, information can be added to the pages in any order.

The page control at the bottom of the contribution wizard may be labeled Next and Previous or the relevant page name, depending on how the collection definition is configured. 

The page control button at the bottom of the screen now points back. (Note: The asterisk displaying after About on both page links is an indication that information has not yet been entered into a mandatory field on that page.)

### Select thumbnail link
The Select thumbnail link enables users to choose which image thumbnail is displayed in the Standard and Images view search results pages.

NOTE: The thumbnail and preview for the Videos view always defaults to the first video in the attachment list. To change which video thumbnail and preview displays on the Videos view page, the Reorder attachments function can be used to put the required video at the top of the list.

1. To select a thumbnail from the contribution wizard page, click the Select thumbnail link
2. Select the Select thumbnail link. This link can also be accessed during editing. The Select thumbnail dialog displays.  All available thumbnails display.
The Select thumbnail dialog displays the following options:
* Default thumbnail – this is the default value, and when selected the first image attachment thumbnail listed is used in the Images view. Additionally, when this option is selected and there are multiple thumbnails available, a rotating thumbnail displays on the Standard results page.
NOTE: If images are reordered using the Reorder attachment function, the image thumbnail that is moved into first place will be the thumbnail used for the Images view when this option is selected.
* No thumbnail – when selected, no thumbnail is displayed on the Images page for this resource. That is, this resource is not represented on the Images view. Additionally, no thumbnail/s display for this resource on the Standard results page.
* Select thumbnail – when selected, the user can select the thumbnail they wish to use for both the Images view and on the Standard results page (image thumbnails will not rotate). 

NOTE: Thumbnails for file types other than images are also generated, and display as selectable options in the Select thumbnail dialog. If a thumbnail is selected for a file type other than an image, the resource will not be represented on the Images view page, as this view is restricted to image file thumbnails. However, the selected thumbnail will display beside the resource title on the Standard view page. For example, if a pdf thumbnail is selected, the resource won’t be represented on the Images view page, but is listed on the Standard results page with the selected pdf thumbnail. 

Once saved, the selected image thumbnail displays in the Images view and on the Standard results pages. 

### Contribute an example resource
To best illustrate the functionality of a contribution wizard, the process of contributing a resource is outlined below.

Keep in mind that contribution wizards are highly configurable and will be tailored to meet the needs of different institutions so may look different from the example.

#### Example

#### Suspend this version
Displays for resources of all statuses. This action hides the resource from searches and is intended for temporary removal of resources from the repository, for example the removal of links for sites that are temporarily unavailable. The resource cannot be discovered but remains accessible via its URL. A Resume this version action is available for suspended resources.


## Wizard controls reference  
## DRM  
The DRM (Digital Rights Management) control is used to gather information on the digital rights associated with contributed items. A DRM control can display two pages in a contribution wizard: a Details page (name DRM – Ownership and rights) and an Access Control page.

The Navigation builder control adds a page to the contribution wizard that allows users to:
* organize resource attachments and links into a package with customized navigation;
* provide content viewers with a ‘split view’ option where attachments can be viewed in two independent panes;
* rename files; and
* specify the viewer type for individual attachments.

The packaged content can be arranged with a single attachment per menu node or organized with multiple tabs to group related attachments together. For example, a menu node can include images grouped with text, HTML, PDF or video attachments containing information such as transcripts and translations.
