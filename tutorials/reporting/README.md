# Reporting wiki space

This is a space dedicated to helping you get the most out of the data 
contained in your EQUELLA institution(s).

It is intended to be the place to go to for:

-   Tutorials for writing a particular query
-   Help writing the most efficient query for your database and EQUELLA
 instance
-   Understanding the intricacies of the EQUELLA SQL schema - 
[Why does the EQUELLA schema make no sense?!](SchemaDesign.md)
-   Learn about reports that other users  have created
-   Picking the right dataset type for the job

## Tutorials

These tutorials are designed to be followed in order but more advanced 
report writers might like to skip ahead. 

For simplicity all items being reported on with these tutorials will use a 
common [reporting tutorial schema](ReportingTutorialSchema.md).

### Querying using SQL

The SQL demonstrated in these tutorials can be used with reporting tools other than BIRT. 
We do specific datasource integration with BIRT but [see here](WithoutBIRT.md) for 
alternatives to those integrations.

You can see the results of the tutorials in action on the [betadev reporting](https://betadev.equella.net/reports/access/reports.do) 
institution which contains example BIRT reports containing the queries discussed in 
these tutorials.

1. [Querying strings](QueryingStrings.md)
1. [Querying with the native XML type](QueryingXMLType.md)
